# OpenCode Integration

OpenCode is a fully supported AI integration for mxcli. It gets deep support: a dedicated configuration directory, project-level context in `AGENTS.md`, skill files that teach the AI MDL patterns, slash commands for common operations, and Starlark lint rules.

## Initializing a project

Use the `--tool opencode` flag:

```bash
mxcli init --tool opencode /path/to/my-mendix-project
```

To set up both OpenCode and Claude Code together:

```bash
mxcli init --tool opencode --tool claude /path/to/my-mendix-project
```

## What gets created

After running `mxcli init --tool opencode`, your project directory gains:

```
my-mendix-project/
├── AGENTS.md                    # Universal AI assistant guide (OpenCode reads this)

```

### opencode.json

The `opencode.json` file is OpenCode's primary configuration. It points to `AGENTS.md` for instructions and to both the OpenCode-format skills in `.opencode/skills/` and the universal skill files in `.ai-context/skills/`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "instructions": [
    "AGENTS.md",
    ".opencode/skills/**/SKILL.md",
    ".ai-context/skills/*.md"
  ]
}
```

### Skills

Skills live in `.opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and use YAML frontmatter that OpenCode understands:

```markdown
---
name: write-microflows
description: MDL syntax and patterns for creating microflows
compatibility: opencode
---

# Writing Microflows
...
```

Each skill covers a specific area: microflow syntax, page patterns, security setup, and so on. OpenCode reads the relevant skill before generating MDL, which significantly improves output quality.

### Commands

The `.opencode/commands/` directory contains slash commands available inside OpenCode. These mirror the Claude Code commands: `/create-entity`, `/create-microflow`, `/create-page`, `/lint`, and others.

### Lint rules

Lint rules live in `.claude/lint-rules/` regardless of which tool is selected — this is where `mxcli lint` looks for custom Starlark rules. OpenCode init writes the rules there so `mxcli lint` works the same way for both tool choices.

## Setting up the dev container

The dev container setup is identical to the Claude Code workflow. Open your project folder in VS Code, click **"Reopen in Container"** when prompted, and wait for the container to build.

### What's installed in the container

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **mxcli** | Mendix CLI (copied into project root) |
| **MxBuild / mx** | Mendix project validation and building |
| **JDK 21** (Adoptium) | Required by MxBuild |
| **Docker-in-Docker** | Running Mendix apps locally with `mxcli docker` |
| **Node.js** | Playwright testing support |
| **PostgreSQL client** | Database connectivity |

## Starting OpenCode

With the dev container running, open a terminal in VS Code and start OpenCode:

```bash
opencode
```

OpenCode now has access to your project files, the mxcli binary, the skill files in `.opencode/skills/`, and the commands in `.opencode/commands/`.

## How OpenCode works with your project

The workflow mirrors Claude Code exactly:

### 1. Explore

OpenCode uses mxcli commands to understand the project before making changes:

```sql
-- What modules exist?
SHOW MODULES;

-- What entities are in this module?
SHOW ENTITIES IN Sales;

-- What does this entity look like?
DESCRIBE ENTITY Sales.Customer;

-- What microflows exist?
SHOW MICROFLOWS IN Sales;

-- Search for something specific
SEARCH 'validation';
```

### 2. Read the relevant skill

Before writing MDL, OpenCode reads the appropriate skill file from `.opencode/skills/`. If you ask for a microflow, it reads the `write-microflows` skill. If you ask for a page, it reads `create-page`.

### 3. Write MDL

OpenCode generates an MDL script based on the project context and skill guidance:

```sql
/** Customer master data */
@Position(100, 100)
CREATE PERSISTENT ENTITY Sales.Customer (
    Name: String(200) NOT NULL,
    Email: String(200) NOT NULL,
    Phone: String(50),
    IsActive: Boolean DEFAULT true
);
```

### 4. Validate

```bash
./mxcli check script.mdl
./mxcli check script.mdl -p app.mpr --references
```

### 5. Execute

```bash
./mxcli -p app.mpr -c "EXECUTE SCRIPT 'script.mdl'"
```

### 6. Verify

```bash
./mxcli docker check -p app.mpr
```

## Adding OpenCode to an existing project

If you already ran `mxcli init` for another tool and want to add OpenCode support:

```bash
mxcli add-tool opencode
```

This creates `.opencode/`, `opencode.json`, and the lint rules without touching any existing configuration.

## Tips for working with OpenCode

- **Be specific about module names.** Say "Create a Customer entity in the Sales module" rather than just "Create a Customer entity."
- **Mention existing elements.** If you want an association to an existing entity, name it: "Link Order to the existing Sales.Customer entity."
- **Let the AI explore first.** OpenCode will run SHOW and DESCRIBE commands to understand what's already in the project. This leads to better results.
- **Review in Studio Pro.** After changes are applied, open the project in Studio Pro to verify the result visually.
- **Use `mxcli docker check`** to catch issues that `mxcli check` alone might miss.
